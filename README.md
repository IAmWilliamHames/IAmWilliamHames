# William Hames

JavaScript developer who learns by building things from scratch.

## What I'm Building

I construct frameworks, tools, and systems to understand how they work under the hood. Not because I think I can replace what exists, but because building something yourself is the fastest way to understand it completely.

### Recent Projects

**[Leom](https://github.com/IAmWilliamHames/leom)** - Standalone signal-based reactivity core  
A minimal reactive engine with automatic dependency tracking and atomic updates. Built to understand how modern reactive frameworks handle state management and fine-grained reactivity.

**[Fyre](https://github.com/IAmWilliamHames/fyre)** - HTTP server with Rust + Lua scripting  
Combines Rust's performance with Lua's dynamic flexibility. Define endpoint logic in Lua scripts, modify them on the fly, never recompile the server. Built to explore the boundaries between compiled and scripted languages in web servers.

**[MicroView](https://github.com/IAmWilliamHames/MicroView)** - Vanilla JavaScript framework  
Component abstraction, signal-based reactivity, and state management without libraries. Built to demystify what modern frameworks actually do when you write JSX or template syntax.

## Technical Focus

Currently exploring: JavaScript internals, framework architecture, React, Node.js, Express.js, Astro, system design patterns.

## Writing

I share what I build and what I learn on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamwilliamhames/).
